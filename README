Disclaimer:  Much of the code included in this project have been written
             by other developers who has worked on solving specific problems
             in their own projects. The source code I've used from other
             projects are left mostly in their entirety, and the credit
             is due where necessary. My value-add in this project was to
             combine these components to interact with eachother.
